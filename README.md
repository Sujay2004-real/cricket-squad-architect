Cricket Squad Architect
The Ultimate AI-Powered Cricket Draft & Auction Game
Welcome to Cricket Squad Architect, a strategic cricket draft and auction game that challenges you to build a championship-caliber team. Unlike traditional fantasy sports, this game focuses on the art of team construction through a unique, skill-based auction process, now enhanced with powerful AI features from the Gemini API.

‚ú® Key Features
Complex Draft & Auction Engine: Experience a unique, round-robin draft system with a priority-based auction, bidding, challenges, and high-stakes rules like "Exact Match" and "Forced Pick".

Strategic Team Management: Start with a fixed purse and draft a full squad of 27 players across Gold, Silver, and Bronze slabs, each with unique perks and accomplishments.

Offline Gameplay: Play anytime, anywhere against 9 intelligent CPU opponents with adaptive strategies.

Interactive Tutorial: A guided, learn-by-doing tutorial that makes the complex rules easy to understand for first-time players.

AI Team Name Suggester (Gemini Powered): Get creative and epic team names generated by an AI to kickstart your journey.

AI Squad Analyst (Gemini Powered): Receive an in-depth, expert analysis of your final squad's strengths, weaknesses, and strategic potential.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
This project is built as a single, self-contained web application with zero dependencies, making it incredibly lightweight and portable.

Frontend: HTML5, Tailwind CSS, Vanilla JavaScript (ES6 Modules)

AI Integration: Google Gemini API (gemini-2.5-flash-preview-05-20) for generative AI features.

üöÄ How to Run Locally
You can run this project on any PC or Android device with a modern web browser.

On a PC (Windows/Mac/Linux)
Download: Download the index.html file from this repository.

Open: Double-click the index.html file. It will open directly in your default web browser.

On an Android Phone
Transfer File: Copy the index.html file from your PC to your phone's storage (e.g., into the Downloads folder) using a USB cable or a cloud service like Google Drive.

Open with Browser: Use your phone's "Files" app to locate the index.html file and tap on it. It will open in your mobile browser.

üß† How It Works: Code Overview
The entire application is contained within a single index.html file, demonstrating a clean and efficient Single-Page Application (SPA) architecture.

HTML (The Skeleton): Defines the structure for all screens (homeScreen, gameScreen, etc.). Screens are toggled between visible and hidden states using CSS.

CSS (The Style): Uses Tailwind CSS for rapid, utility-first styling and a small block of custom CSS for animations and specific UI elements.

JavaScript (The Brain):

Game Loop: The core logic is managed by a sequence of functions (startRound, processRoundPicks, handleAuction, endRound) that control the flow of the game.

State Management: The gameState and teams objects hold all the real-time data for the game, acting as the "single source of truth".

Gemini API Integration: The callGeminiApi function provides a reusable interface for sending prompts to the Gemini model and processing the response, powering the AI features.

üîÆ Future Development
This project is built with scalability in mind. Future enhancements could include:

Online PvP Mode: A real-time, multiplayer version using a cloud backend like Firebase.

Live Data Integration: Connecting to a live sports API to dynamically update player stats and perks.

League and Tournament Play: Allowing users to create private leagues and compete over a season.
